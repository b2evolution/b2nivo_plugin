# b2nivo Plugin

## Not official

Some errors in the plugin were fixed by the b2evolution team but this plugin is **not** officially supported by the b2evolution team.

## Download

You can download the packaged plugin from: http://plugins.b2evolution.net/b2nivo-plugin

## Instructions:

1. Upload the plugin folder in your `../plugins/` folder
2. Install the plugin (you will see "Nivo Slider Widget" upon installation) under your collection settings > widgets.
3. **Go to collection settings > widgets and place "Nivo Slider Widget" anywhere in your "widget" containers.**
4. That's all , really. If you are a novice user, just replace the images (1.jpg, 2.jpg) under the plugins folder.If you know your way around, you have LOTS of options to fiddle with.
5. **Finally DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE "SLIDER_ID" if you are going to use MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF THE WIDGET.**
